Simple "cheat engine" aiming to help an examinee to take an online exam / interviewing in front of the screen

This program was made in under an hour, including the time to research the documentation of Python's tkinter module which I have never used before.

The idea came up while I was trying to help a friend who was about to have an oral exam over a Zoom meeting.

I would sit next to him on my laptop running the Server, while he was interviewing with the examiner on his computer and running the Client window at the same time.

He and I would collaborate (or you can say collude) to give the best answer.

I would have to listen to the questions, think, then type very quickly my answers on my laptop's screen. The concept is identical to the collaboration's functionality on Google Docs app, only that mine is much more snappy since we would connect to each other on local network. Changes on my screen are updated nearly instantly on my friend's (the server's code check for changes every 0.2 second).

Cheating is bad, but ALL HAIL TO TECHNOLOGY!!!
